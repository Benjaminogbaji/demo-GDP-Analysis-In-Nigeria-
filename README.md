## Introduction
The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of a country is a critical indicator of its economic health, reflecting the total value of all goods and services produced over a specific time period. Understanding the trends and changes in GDP can provide valuable insights into the economic performance and potential growth areas within a country. This analysis focuses on the GDP of Nigeria from 2020 to 2024 providing a comprehensive overview of its performance during this period.

## Objectives

- Highlight Key Metrics: Focus on critical metrics such as the real GDP values, percentage change this quarter versus last quarter, and the percentage change this quarter versus the same quarter last year to provide a clear picture of economic performance.
  
- Visualize Data for Better Understanding: Utilize Excel and Power BI to present the GDP data effectively, including line charts to show the quarterly trend of GDP and bar charts to display the percentage change in real GOP for preceding years.
  
- Provide Contextual Analysis: Offer contextual explanations for observed GDP trends and growth rates, linking economic events, climate and seasonality, and policies to their potential impacts on the GDP.
